# Specialization in front-end with React.js
This is the course name that I am taking in IT Academy, which is an academy from Barcelona Activa that teaches about tech.

The course consists in several sprints, where each one is about 2 weeks long.
In each sprint, I will go deeper in:
1. HTML, CSS (part 1)
2. HTML, CSS (part 2)
3. Javascript (part 1)
4. Javascript (part 2)
